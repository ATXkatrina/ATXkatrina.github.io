  <h2>A little background..</h2>
    <p>The pool is fed by a natural spring, and maintains a constant temperature between 68 and 71 degrees year-round.</p>
   <p>Long considered sacred, the springs were used by the Tonkawa Native American tribe before the Spanish settled the area in the 17th century.</p>
    <p>The city was deeded the springs, and the surrounding area, by Andrew Zilker (the namesake for the springs' home, Zilker park), and in the 1920s the city expanded the swimming area by damning the springs and building concrete sides.</p>
  <h3>What to expect</h3>
    <p>In addition to the fridgid temperature, the pool's natural, uneven limestone bottom contributes to this unique swimming pool,Â complete with grasses and even small fishes!</p>
  <h3>Planning your trip!</h3>
    <p>The pool is generally open yearround from 5 a.m. to 10 p.m. Friday through Wednesday, and admission to the pool is $3 for Austin residents. Admission is free in the winter and in the summer from 9 p.m. until closing.</p>
